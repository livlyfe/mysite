        <h3>Developer & Photographer</h3>
        <p>I started learning Photography when I was 16 years old in highschool. I knew I liked it, but never pursuit it until I was 24 years old. I discovered photoshop and I loved what I could create with my raw images. I was later bit by the
          coding bug and decided to take a web development course on udemy. It was the best $9.99 of my life. Now I work at a start up as a software developer and I also freelance creating website themes for Wordpress.</p>

        <h3>The Interest Path of Self Development</h3>
        <p>With all the skills I have deloped out of sheer interests. I have discovered my main passion which is helping people find their path to success from their interests. I have noticed the amount of people who are depressed because they are
          lost and simply have no idea what their purpose in life is. I help people develop their interests and intern help find their purpose and or passion!</p>
